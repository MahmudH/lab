## Core AWS Services and Concepts with Decision-Making Framework

### Compute Services

#### EC2: Virtual Servers in the Cloud
- **Instance Types and Selection Criteria**:
  - **Compute-optimized (C-series)**: Choose for CPU-intensive workloads like batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers
  - **Memory-optimized (R-series)**: Select when your workload needs to process large datasets in memory (in-memory databases, real-time analytics)
  - **General purpose (T/M-series)**: Ideal for balanced workloads with moderate CPU and memory needs (web servers, small databases)
  - **Storage-optimized (I/D-series)**: Best for workloads requiring high, sequential read/write access to large datasets (data warehousing, log processing)
  - **GPU instances (G/P-series)**: Choose for machine learning, video rendering, and graphics-intensive applications

- **Pricing Models - Decision Framework**:
  - **On-Demand**: Choose when workloads are unpredictable, short-term, or for development/testing (highest flexibility, highest cost)
  - **Reserved**: Select for steady-state, predictable workloads where you can commit to 1-3 years (up to 72% savings vs On-Demand)
  - **Spot**: Implement for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads that can handle interruptions (batch jobs, data analysis, up to 90% savings)
  - **Savings Plans**: Best for organizations wanting commitment-based discounts with flexibility across services and instance types

- **Placement Groups - Strategic Usage**:
  - **Cluster**: Implement for low-latency, high-throughput applications needing inter-instance communication (HPC, tightly-coupled node clusters)
  - **Spread**: Choose for critical applications requiring maximum availability by placing instances on separate hardware (primary/replica databases)
  - **Partition**: Select for large distributed workloads like Hadoop or Cassandra that need to control instance placement across failure domains

- **User Data and Metadata**:
  - Use user data for bootstrap scripts to configure instances at launch
  - Use instance metadata service for dynamic configuration and information retrieval

- **Instance Store vs EBS - Decision Points**:
  - **Instance Store**: Choose for temporary storage, cache, or scratch data where data loss during stop/termination is acceptable (higher IOPS, no additional cost)
  - **EBS**: Select when data persistence is required beyond instance lifecycle (databases, file systems)

#### Lambda: Serverless Compute

- Review explanations even for questions you answered correctly

Remember: The exam is designed to test your ability to make architectural decisions based on specific requirements and constraints. Understanding why certain services or configurations are appropriate for specific scenarios is more important than memorizing service limits or features. Focus on developing a decision framework that helps you evaluate options systematically based on the unique needs of each scenario.
